# Sono Zen - Landing Page & Lead Capture System

## Overview

Sono Zen is a sleep wellness product landing page built to promote and sell a 7-night Oriental sleep method. The application serves as a complete marketing funnel with lead capture, customer testimonials, detailed product information, and purchase processing capabilities. It's designed as a modern, conversion-optimized landing page targeting people struggling with sleep issues.

## System Architecture

This is a full-stack web application built with a modern monorepo structure:

**Frontend**: React with TypeScript, using Vite for build tooling and development
**Backend**: Express.js API server with TypeScript
**Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
**Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components for a cohesive design system
**Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
**State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management

The application follows a monorepo pattern with clear separation between client, server, and shared code.

## Key Components

### Frontend Architecture
- **Component Library**: Built on shadcn/ui with custom Sono Zen theming

- **Data Validation**: Zod schemas for runtime type checking
- **Storage Interface**: Abstracted storage layer supporting both in-memory (development) and database (production) storage
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling with proper HTTP status codes

### Database Schema

## Data Flow

1. **Landing Page**: Visitors scroll through sections explaining sleep problems and the Sono Zen solution
2. **Lead Capture**: Throughout the page, forms capture visitor information for email marketing
3. **Purchase Flow**: Primary CTA buttons direct to pricing section for immediate purchase

## Deployment Strategy

The application is configured for deployment on Replit with:

- **Development**: `npm run dev` starts both frontend and backend with hot reloading
- **Production Build**: `npm run build` creates optimized bundles using Vite and ESBuild
- **Production Server**: `npm run start` serves the built application
- **Database**: PostgreSQL connection via environment variable `DATABASE_URL`
- **Port Configuration**: Server runs on port 5000, mapped to external port 80

The build process:
1. Vite builds the React frontend to `dist/public`
2. ESBuild bundles the Express server to `dist/index.js`
3. Static files are served from the frontend build directory
